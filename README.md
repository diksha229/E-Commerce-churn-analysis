# E-Commerce-churn-analysis

# Overview
In this project, I used SQL to analyze customer churn patterns from an e-commerce dataset.By writing complex queries across tables like user activity, orders, and support tickets, I identified key factors contributing to churn. The goal was to help the business understand why customers leave and what actions can be taken to retain them.
# Objectives 
* To explore and understand customer behavior by analyzing interactions, purchases, and support history using SQL queries.

* To identify key reasons behind customer churn through data patterns and trends across multiple tables.

* To provide actionable insights that can help reduce churn and improve customer retention strategies.
